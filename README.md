# A small project on Macros in Microsoft excel

Recorded and implemented macros in microsoft excel for transfering of data from one sheet to another and then for creating invoices from the data as required.
This is a simple data entry and invoice workbook; where data is fed into **Data Entry** sheet and with the help of macros that data will be put in the **Table** sheet.

In the **Invoice Template** sheet Vlookup is used at places where *"Customer"* details need to be fetched from the **Table** sheet.

A button is assigned for each of the macros, namely ***Transfer*** and ***Issue Invoice*** to make life easy and to properly utilize the power of macros in excel.

Below is the working of the macros in action:
